PURPOSE

Launch Amazon EC2 instances from Node.js and execute callbacks when the
instances are available.

node-ec2 is a minimal Node.js API with absolutely no sugar. node-ec2 signs your
get requests and converts the XML responses to JSON. Becasue of this, there is a
one to one mapping between the Amazon Query API and the actions provided by
node-ec2 and changes to the Amazon Query API are available immediately to
node-ec2 applications.

You can learn more about node-ec2 at the node-ec2 GitHub web page and by reading
the wiki.
